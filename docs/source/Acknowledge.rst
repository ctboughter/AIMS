This initial stable build has only been possible through a highly collaborative effort focused on creating a functional pipeline with the incorporated features necessary for thorough repertoire analysis. I have many, many people to thank for getting AIMS to where it is today, but have the space to list only a few here. The following people have made major contributions to this project:

**Anna Borowska - UX/UI Designer**
As the sole graphic designing consultant on the project, Anna helped ensure the initial application was functional, efficient, and as easy to use as possible. Multiple quality control features within the application were added based on suggestions from Anna, and her comprehensive user testing reports ensured critical functionalities were improved. To contact Anna or view her portfolio, see her website: https://annazofiaborowska.com/

**Marta Borowska - Scientific Consultant/Beta Tester**
The initial scientific inquiry behind this project was initiated by Marta, looking at the biochemical mechanisms behind antibody polyreactivity. In addition to her scientific insights, Marta was an early tester of the antibody/TCR software module.

**Caitlin Castro - Scientific Consultant/Beta Tester**
Caitlin, the resource for all things immunology, helped with the initial design and testing of the MHC-like software module. Caitlin also helped with interpretation of results and had critical insights for the improvement of the user experience.

**Jay Pittman - Beta Tester**
Jay was responsible for the earliest tests of the GUI, helping to resolve critical bugs in GUI function on Windows OS. Conversations with Jay helped solidify the application of this approach to more diverse molecules beyond those involved in immune recognition.

**Erin Adams & Lab - Mentorship/Funding**
Erin's expertise and helpful mentoring allowed this project to reach its full potential. Erin was fully supportive of the addition of a new project to the lab, and had great comments for making the analysis pipeline more accessible to experimentalists. Erin's advice has been invaluable throughout. For more information on Erin's lab, see http://ejadamslab.bsd.uchicago.edu/. This project was supported with funding from Erin's National Institutes of Health NIAID grants R01 AI115471 and R01 AI147954.

**Benoit Roux & Lab - Mentorship/Funding**
Benoit provided consistent feedback throughout the project, providing his expertise and insights for all matters biophyscial. Specifically, his insights into the general biophysics of protein-protein interactions helped guide this project. More information on Benoit's lab can be found at http://thallium.bsd.uchicago.edu/RouxLab/. This project was supported with funding from Benoit's National Science Foundation grant MCB-1517221.

**Martin Meier-Scherllersheim, LISB, NIAID, NIH - Mentorship/Funding**
Development of AIMS has continued in Martin's group, with support coming from project number ZIA AI001076-15.

**Martin Flajnik & Lab - MHC Module Collaborators**
The MHC module of this project was started due to a collaboration with the Flajnik lab, and sequences used in the mhc_testData directory were isolated by this research group. More information on the Flajnik lab can be found at: https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Flajnik-Martin/ .
